# Awesome Agent Memory 🧠

A curated list of papers, codes, and datasets focused on **Agent Memory**—the architecture enabling Large Language Models (LLMs) to retain, recall, and evolve experiences over time. This repository tracks the industry shift from static RAG to dynamic, self-evolving, and parameter-efficient memory systems.

## 👋 Introduction

As LLM agents move from simple chatbots to autonomous entities, **Memory** is the bottleneck. This collection focuses on:
* **Context Engineering:** How to manage infinite or long-horizon context.
* **Self-Evolution:** Agents that learn from past mistakes and successes.
* **Architectural Shifts:** Moving from vector databases to graph-based and biological-inspired systems.
